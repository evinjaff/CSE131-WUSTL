	 * Examples of lists:
	 * List <Color> -> A list of a color palette used to paint a canvas
	 * List <Account> -> A list of accounts in a municipal district
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Roulette Wheel List
	 * Since we just want to report the numbers it spins, it's best to
	 * store it as an int rather than a frequency count object because spitting out the
	 * raw numbers is closer to what is asked of the list
	 * 
	 * List <boolean> -> A list that stores whether or not you won a hand of blackjack
	 * 
	 * Possible List Operations
	 * 
	 * Add/Remove Items
	 * Mark items on list as "done" or "computed"
	 * Change properties of items in list
