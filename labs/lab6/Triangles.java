		 When I think of how to solve the triangle problem when it comes to recursion,
		 I think of one simple way to do it. Start with a large, black triangle:
		   *
		  ***
		 *****
		and then draw the midpoints of each side of the triangle, and connect the midpoints.
		After that, color in the internal shaded area by the midpoints. This would all be written
		into a method that cuts the central triangle from a triangle. Then, set the program loose,
		running until it eventually gets a return of there being no more triangles to cut. Supposedly,
		This creates an infinite fractal, but you could allways add a hand brake of stopping the 
		method once the identified triangle is x amount of pixels tall.
